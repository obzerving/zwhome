Writing Rules

Rule file formats
1. <Action> <device|devicelist> FROM|FROM! <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist> TO|TO!|TO@ <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist>

2. <Action> <device|devicelist> FROM|FROM! <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist> TO|TO!|TO@ <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist> IF|EXCEPT-IF FROM <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist> TO <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist>

3. <Action> <device|devicelist> FROM|FROM! <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist> TO|TO!|TO@ <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist> WHEN|EXCEPT-WHEN <sensor> is|is-less-than|is-greater-than <sensor value>

4. <Action> <device|devicelist> ON|ON! <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist>

5. <Action> <device|devicelist> ON|ON! <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist> IF|EXCEPT-IF FROM <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist> TO <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist>

6. <Action> <device|devicelist> ON|ON! <date|datelist> AT <time|timelist>  WHEN|EXCEPT-WHEN <sensor> <|=|> <sensor value>

where
<Action> is of the form set|<on_action>|<off_action>
<on_action> can be a number from 0 to 99, where 0 is off and 99 is the highest power level. You can also use the keyword "on" to represent 99 and the keyword "off" to represent 0.
<off_action> can be a number from 0 to 99, where 0 is off and 99 is the highest power level. You can also use the keyword "on" to represent 99 and the keyword "off" to represent 0.
<device|devicelist> can be either a single switch-type device (e.g. dining-room.chandelier) or list of devices (e.g. dining-room.chandelier|deck.light). The format of a device name is location.name
<date|datelist> can be either a single date (e.g. 1-jan) or a list of dates (e.g 1-jan|20-feb|monday)
<time|timelist> can be an absolute 24-hour time (e.g. 2300), relative to sunrise (e.g. sunrise+10 means 10 minutes after sunrise) or relative to sunset (e.g. sunset-90 means 90 minutes before sunset).

Example rules:
# Turn on the kitchen.crock-pot every friday at 10am and turn it off on saturday at 1PM
set|on|off kitchen.crock-pot from friday at 1000 to saturday at 1300

# turn on the dining-room.chandelier to 40 percent brightness 90 minutes before sunset on the next occurance of january 25 (including today if today is 25-jan) and turn it off the next sunday at midnight
set|40|0 dining-room.chandelier from 25-jan at sunset-90 to sunday at 0000

# turn-off the kitchen light on saturday and sunday from sunrise to sunset
# The from! keyword ensures that, while the time is between the FROM and TO dates/times, even if someone turns on the light manually, it will go off again within five minutes
# The to! keyword ensures that after the TO date/time, even if someone turns off the light after sunset, it will come back on again after five minutes
set|off|on kitchen.light from! saturday|sunday at sunrise to! saturday|sunday at sunset

# The to@ keyword is like the to! keyword, but instead of the device changing state when the TO date/time is reached, the system just stops enforcing the device's current state.
# So, the following rule works like the previous one except that the light can be turned off after sunset and it won't come back on again.
set|off|on kitchen.light from! saturday|sunday at sunrise to@ saturday|sunday at sunset

# turn on the dining-room.chandelier and kitchen light every saturday from 9PM to 11PM unless it's January 1 or December 25
set|on|off dining-room.chandelier|kitchen-light from saturday at 2100 to saturday at 2300 except-if from 1-jan|25-dec at 0000 to 1-jan|25-dec at 2359
# alternate way of writing this rule
set|on|off dining-room.chandelier|kitchen-light from saturday at 2100 to saturday at 2300 except-if from 1-jan|25-dec to 1-jan|25-dec
# yet another alternate way
set|on|off dining-room.chandelier|kitchen-light from saturday at 2100 to saturday at 2300 except-if on 1-jan|25-dec

# turn on the dining-room.chandelier every saturday from noon to 3PM if the light sensor reads less than 400 lux
# What really happens:	The program will check the sensor (every 10 minutes if the device is off; every 30 minutes if the device is on) between the hours of noon and 3PM on Saturday. On each check,
#			If the sensor reads less than 400 lux, the dining-room.chandelier will turn on (or stay on).
#			If the sensor reads more than 400 lux, the dining-room.chandelier will turn off (or stay off).
# This means it's possible that you could have the light cycling on every 10 minutes and off every 30 minutes.
# When the rule becomes inactive at 3PM, the device will remain in the same state as the last command it was given.
set|on|off dining-room.chandelier from saturday at 1200 to saturday at 1500 when light-sensor < 400

Rule constraints
1. The From-event-date may be any combination of date types
2. The number of From-event-times must either equal the number of From-event-dates or be a single time. If a single time, the list of From-event-times will be filled out to the number of From-event-dates by repeating it.
3. The number of To-event-dates must equal the number of From-event-dates.
4. The number of To-event-times must either equal the number of To-event-dates or be a single time. If a single time, the list of To-event-times will be filled out to the number of To-event-dates by repeating it.
5. The On-event-date may be any combination of date types
6. The number of On-event-times must either equal the number of On-event-dates or be a single time. If a single time, the list of On-event-times will be filled out to the number of On-event-dates by repeating it.
7. If a time-bound condition clause (IF|EXCEPT-IF) is present, it is checked before the event clause.
8. The From-condition-date may be any combination of date types
9. The number of From-condition-times must either equal the number of From-condition-dates or be a single time. If a single time, the list of From-condition-times will be filled out to the number of From-condition-dates by repeating it.
10. The number of To-condition-dates must equal the number of From-condition-dates.
11. The number of To-condition-times must either equal the number of To-condition-dates or be a single time. If a single time, the list of To-condition-times will be filled out to the number of To-condition-dates by repeating it.
12. If a sensor-bound condition clause (WHEN|EXCEPT-WHEN) is present, it is checked before the event clause.
13. The AT keyword is optional. If it's missing after the From-event-date or From-condition-date, it is assumed to be 0000. If missing after the To-event-date or To-condition-date, it is assumed to be 2359.
14. Overlapping event dates/times in a given rule should be avoided because it will produce unpredictable results. It's better to have a rule with the same event time period for all the event date periods. For example, it's okay to have a date list from Tuesday|4-Jul to Tuesday|4-Jul, even if July 4th comes out on a Tuesday this year. However, you wouldn't want a time list of 0700|0900 to 1700|1500.
15. In theory, once an ON event triggers, the device(s) should enter the <action> state (i.e. on or off) and stay there forever. In practice, the ON clause really means "FROM <datelist> AT <timelist> TO 31-DEC AT 2359"
