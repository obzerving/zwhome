Configuration File Format

By default, zwhome looks for a file named zwconfig.txt. Under Linux, you can specify a different configuration file by putting its name after the program name (e.g. "zwhome zwconfig.txt"). Each line is of the format

command_type parameter1 parameter2

The recognized command_types and their associated parameters are:

wifisensor sensor_name RESTuri|min_value|max_value|capabilities

This is used for specifying a custom wifi sensor device. You give it a name you can reference in the rules file.

There are two types of wifi sensors, which are distinguished by their RESTuri. If the RESTuri is simply the keyword "client," then it automatically reports its data to zwhome's server in the format
http://zwhome:8000/sensors/<sensor_name>?param=<sensor_parameter>&value=<integer_value>

Otherwise, zwhome will periodically request a reading from the sensor by sending it a request of the format
http://<sensor_ip/<sensor_parameter>

The Capabilities field is a number indicating what type of sensor it is. The definitions are
1  - Motion Sensor
2  - Humidity Sensor
4  - Temperature Sensor
8  - Light Sensor
16 - Can report its supply voltage


Example 1: For the OTALightSensor, whose IP address is 192.168.1.3, has a minimum value of 0 lux, a maximum value of 16000 lux, and sends reading upon request, the entry in zwconfig would be
wifisensor kitchen.light-sensor http://192.168.1.3|0|16000|8

Using the sensor in a rule:
set|on|off kitchen.light from monday at 0800 to monday at sunset when kitchen.light-sensor_luminance < 2500

Example 2: For a temperature sensor that has a minimum value of 12 deg F, a maximum value of 144 deg F, and sends periodic reports to zwhome, the entry in zwconfig would be
wifisensor bedroom.temp-sensor client|12|144|4

Using the sensor in a rule:
set|on|off bedroom.fan_medium from friday at 0600 to friday at 1800 when bedroom.temp-sensor_temperature > 80

wifiswitch switch_name RESTuri|capabilities

This is used for specifying a custom wifi switch device. You give it a name you can reference in the rules file.

The Capabilities field is a number indicating what type of switch it is. The definitions are
16  - Can report its supply voltage
32  - Can be dimmed, which implies that it is a multi-level switch; 0-99
64  - Is a light switch, which implies that it is a binary switch; 0 or 99
128 - Is a fan switch, which implies that it has three speeds; low, medium, and high

Example: For a fanctrl switch, whose IP address is 192.168.1.4
wifiswitch bedroom.fan http://192.168.1.4|128

Using the switch in a rule:
set|on|off bedroom.fan_low from tuesday at 1100 to tuesday at 1300

days english sunday|monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday|saturday

This command allows you to specify how you reference the days of the week in the rules file. If you didn't have this line in the config file, it would default to "sunday" ... "saturday"

months gregorian jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec

This command allows you to specify how you reference the months of the year in the rules file. If you didn't have this line in the config file, it would default to "jan" ... "dec"

months hebrew tishrei|cheshvan|kislev|teves|shvat|adar|nissan|iyar|sivan|tamuz|av|elul|adar1|adar2

You can specify a date in the Hebrew calendar, too. This command allows you to specify how you reference the hebrew months of the year in the rules file. If you didn't have this line in the config file, it would default to "tishrei" ... "adar2"

location home latitude|longitude|timezone

This command allows you to specify your home location. If you didn't have this line in the config file, the location would default to "39.3|-76.6| -5"

file file_name file_path

This is used to specify files used by zwHome. Right now, you must specify the "rules" file_name in the config file. For example,

file rules /home/pi/rulefile.txt

In this example, the file "rulefile.txt" must exist in the /home/pi directory before zwHome is launched.

define label_name definition

This is used to define a text string that will be substituted for its definition in the rules file. For example, if you place this command in the config.txt file

define weekend saturday|sunday

and place this rule in the rules file

turn|on|off kitchen-light from [weekend] at 0900 to [weekend] at 1700

it will be the same as if you wrote the rule

turn|on|off kitchen-light from saturday|sunday at 0900 to saturday|sunday at 1700
